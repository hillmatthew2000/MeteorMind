🚀 USAGE EXAMPLES
-----------------
Command Line Interface:
> python main.py cli
> Select option 1 to get current weather
> Select option 2 to get weather forecast
> Select option 8 to generate reports

Graphical Interface:
> python main.py gui
> Use the "Current Weather" tab for real-time data
> Use the "Forecast" tab for 5-day predictions
> Use the "History" tab for reports and analysis

Demonstration Mode:
> python demo_reporting.py
> View sample reports and export examples

📈 DEMONSTRATION RESULTS
------------------------
The reporting system demonstration successfully generated:
